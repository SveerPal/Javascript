What is premative and non premative data
    premative data=string ,int ,float ,char
    non premative data=array ,object,recurssion  
time complexity
    time complexity is mainly calculated by counting the number of step to finish the execution.
space complexity
    space complexity is the amount of space required to solve  problem 
    space complexity =auxiliary space +input size

 Recursion: a function which call him self continue. and codiotion is most important 
                in recursion because functio did not get in infinete    
                will use for add fuctionality without loop 

    Direct Recursion
    InDirect Recursion
        Head and Tail Recursion  
            Head Recursion: perform action above of recursion function called 
            Tail Recursion: perform action below of recursion function called     

Stack: work on last in first out system because it has one way to delete or insert data

Queue: work on first in first out because it has one way to insert data and other way to delete data
    Enqueue: add item in Queue (Rear End)
    Dequeue: remove item from Queue (Front End)      
    Circular Queue: in start both rear and front end will be same  

Search:
    Linear Search: In Linear check one by one , in Linear Search complexity will be n where f{n)=O(n)              
    Binary Search: first we need to sort array with out sort Binary search will not work
                    number of input divide in half then it start to search when it start searching
                     it will check from mid point if search point is equal to mid point it will give 
                     number ,if search point is less than from mid point it will start check from
                      left side otherwise it will start from right side  it will keep deviding 
                      again and again array(left and right) untill we find the element       
        iterative approch: use loop
        recursive approch:  use recursive function
